# Storymaker Actor

## Branch v0

This branch adds the basic functionality of the Storymaker Actor.

It allows users to create and manage stories through a simple interface. There is no advanced functionality, just an AI that helps generate a single chapter of a story based on provided user input. The input is not validated.

The `actor.json` file is fully configured with metadata, memory limits, and a link to this README file, but does not link to any additional schemas, since they do not exist yet.
